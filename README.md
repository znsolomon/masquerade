Created in 48 hours for the Game Design Society's Halloween Game Jam in Winter 2017. The files were uploaded on November 2nd 2018 to serve as a record. All the assets are included here. Copying them into a unity project should produce the game. For the sake of brevity I have not included all the unity-specific files, as your computer should generate them automatically.
